# FetchCodingChallange
Coding Challenge for Fetch

This Repo is intending for Fetch to review my solution to their coding challenge.

The Repo consist of:
  - 3 JSON data files, provided by Fetch
  - 1 Python FILE, work of importing the data into a Database
  - 1 SQL file, answers to the 6 query questions and quires I wrote
  - 1 Response communication
  - 1 PDF containing the database schema diagram

For my Database version I use DuckDB as it is compatible with ANSI SQL
