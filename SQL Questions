Query Question1:

Q:What are the top 5 brands by receipts scanned for most recent month?

A:NULL brandcode is the only result for the latest month based on Scanned Date. 
If we alter our query to exclude the first date of March 2021 and look at Feb 2021, we see the following results:
  NULL      │         114 │
│ BRAND     │           3 │
│ MISSION   │           2 │
│ VIVA      │		        1

NULL still been the major brand code but we get other brands coming in now.

Query Question2:

Q:How does the ranking of the top 5 brands by receipts scanned for the recent month compare to the ranking for the previous month?

A:Looking at Feb 2021 as the previous month, we see NULL still been the major brand, but we also now see other Brand Names coming in:
  NULL      │         114 │
│ BRAND     │           3 │
│ MISSION   │           2 │
│ VIVA      │		        1
If we assume March to be invalid due to too little data coming in. 
We see a different array of brand names coming into the top 5 brands for Jan 2021:
  NULL           │         504 │
│ BEN AND JERRYS │          32 │
│ PEPSI          │          23 │
│ FOLGERS        │          23 │
│ KELLOGG'S      │          22
NULL is still the top Brand Name but all other Brand Names have changed from Jan to Feb based on Top 5 brands

Query Question5:

Q:Which brand has the most spend among users who were created within the past 6 months?

A:Based on using Brand Codes from just rewardItemList, 
null would be the highest brand for users who joined in the past six month. 
But if we join in brands data and join on Barcode and BrandCode we get a different story, 
TOSTITOS becomes the highest spend brand. 
This tells us that the brandcode and brandCode within rewardsItemlist is not been appended correctly 
and does not match the brand code in brands data.

Q:Which brand has the most spend among users who were created within the past 6 months?

But if we join rewardsitemlist and brands on barcode and brand code, 
we see SWANSON and TOSTITOS as the top brands. But Eem to be excluding a large portion of transactions
